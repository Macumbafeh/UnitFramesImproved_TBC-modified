# UnitFramesImproved_TBC-modified
Modified version of UnitFramesImproved_TBC to mimic EasyFrames addon

It use also the FocusFrame Fixed version for UnitFramesImproved_TBC to be darker and with Class Color.

## I modified :
- Default scale of the Player and Target scale is 1.3
- Player Buff and Party member scale at 1.6
- Player/Target/Focus Name in top of the frame like Easy Frames
- Removed PvPIcon on Player/Target/focus/Party frames
- Moved the Health text and of the Player/Target/focus frames to be in the center of the health bar, and changed the size
- Changed also the font to FrizQuadrata of the Health and Mana text of the Player/Target/focus/PartyMember
- You can remove the Highlight on the Target when you focus it, just uncomment ""-- TargetFrameFlash:SetAlpha(0)""
- PartyMember are set to 1.6
- I removed the Class Health of the Enemy Player, they are just Red (thanks Null)
- I added TargetOfTarget health support based on reaction grey/red/yellow/green (the default one are just green even for enemies)
